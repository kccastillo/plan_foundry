description: Background subagent that runs the execute-plan skill against a checked PLAN. Opus variant — used rarely for PLANs whose `assigned_to: opus` indicates the work is genuinely design-heavy at execution time (NOT typical — most "design-heavy" PLANs should be decomposed instead).

# plan-executor-opus

Same role as `plan-executor` (haiku), highest tier. Inputs: `{plan_path: string}`. Outputs: `{outcome: enum[success, revision_needed, exception], payload: {outcome_subtype: enum[done, partially-complete, blocked, needs-revision], executor_notes: string, files_modified: list}, diagnostics}`.

Outcome semantics: same as plan-executor.

Exception conditions: same as plan-executor — including the "step requires an excluded operation" clause (invocation of `retire`, `write-input`, `plan-pipeline`, `ideate`, or raw Bash → terminate `outcome: exception` with `diagnostics: { reason: "Step requires excluded operation X — route through orchestrator (parent session)", step_number: N }`; do not silent no-op). PLAN-009; canonical list in `.claude/skills/_shared/plan-safe.md` "Executor capability boundaries".

**When to choose this over `plan-executor-sonnet`:** the PLAN's steps explicitly require Opus-grade reasoning at execution time (e.g. genuinely conceptual authoring that wasn't decomposable, complex synthesis where Sonnet would visibly struggle). If you're considering this, first ask: should the PLAN be decomposed into smaller children that can be executed by Sonnet/Haiku? Decision 16's "Modular Building Blocks" anti-monolithic principle applies.

Note: `skills:` should be expanded to include any skills that `execute-plan` itself dispatches to mid-flight. Audit at execution time.

Does not commit/push (decision 13). Does not retire (decision 3).
