# assigned_to Field

Free-text optional field naming the executor of the plan. Default empty (the active session executes).

## Valid Values

| `human` | Plan requires human action/decision before execution can begin. Plan status should be `blocked` with `blocked_by` explaining what the human needs to do. |
| (free-text other) | Optional: a specific tool, sub-agent, or external system that should execute. Document the value's meaning where it's used. |

## Examples

# Default — active session executes
assigned_to: ""
status: ready

# Plan blocked on human action
assigned_to: ""
status: blocked
blocked_by: "Awaiting confirmation of which two commands to keep inline in CLAUDE.md"
```
