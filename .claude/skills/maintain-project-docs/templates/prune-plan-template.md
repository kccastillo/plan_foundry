## Objective
Remove the following from <CLAUDE.md | .claude/CONTEXT_CONSTITUTION.md | ARCHITECTURE.md | a .claude/skills/_shared/ helper>: <one-paragraph summary>.

## Context
**Trigger:** [what prompted the prune - e.g., over hard cap, dead reference flagged, user request]
**Budget impact:** current line count -> proposed line count.

## Removal candidates

For each candidate:
- **Location:** filename:line-range
- **Content:** [excerpt or summary of what is being removed]
- **Reason:** [why removal is safe - dead reference, duplicated elsewhere, drifted, anti-pattern]
- **Migration target (if any):** [where the content moves to, e.g., `.claude/references/X.md`]
- **Impact assessment:** [what could break if this is removed]

## Steps
1. For each candidate with a migration target: create / update the target file first.
2. Remove the content from the source file.
3. Verify all pointers still resolve.

## Verification
- [ ] Each removal applied
- [ ] Migrated content (if any) is reachable via pointer
- [ ] No previously-passing audit check now fails
- [ ] Line count reduced as expected
