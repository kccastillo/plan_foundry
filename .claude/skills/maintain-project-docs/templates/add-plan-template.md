## Objective
Add the following to <CLAUDE.md | .claude/CONTEXT_CONSTITUTION.md>: <one-paragraph summary>.

## Context
**Trigger:** [what the user asked for, verbatim]
**Target file:** [filename]
**Target section:** [section name + insertion point]
**Budget impact:** current line count -> proposed line count (delta). Vs. soft cap (150) and hard cap (300).
**Dedupe check:** [list any existing rules that overlap; explain why this is still distinct or recommend modifying the existing rule instead]

## Proposed diff

```diff
[exact unified-diff-style proposal: which lines are added, in surrounding context]
```

## Steps
1. Apply the diff above to [filename].
2. Verify line count is within caps.
3. Run audit (mode: audit) to confirm no new anti-pattern introduced.

## Verification
- [ ] [filename] contains the new content at the specified location
- [ ] Line count remains <= 150 (or hard cap exception documented)
- [ ] Subsequent audit shows no new anti-pattern matches
